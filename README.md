===
[![Build Status via Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/AlekseyMalyshev/simpl-redd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlekseyMalyshev/simpl-redd)

This is a very basic implementation of reddit clone designed with Test Driven Develoment.

This implements users and posts.

In my model posts and comments are the same kind of objects.

UI is very limited - only thread list at this time.

## Testing

Simply clone the ropository and run

```
mocha
```

## Installation

run:

```
npm install && bower install
```

then

```
node server.js
```
